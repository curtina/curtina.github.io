                        <h2>High-energy Counterparts to Fast Radio Bursts</h2>
                        <p> One of the primary projects of my PhD has been to search for 
                            high-energy counterparts to fast radio bursts. More specifically, I am interested
                            in whether fast radio bursts might be radio counterparts to gamma-ray bursts. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are transient
                            gamma-ray events with particularly high energies. GRBs are 
                            often split into two categories: short and long GRBs. Short GRBs typically have durations less than 2
                            seconds, and are thought to be produced during the merger of two compact objects (e.g., a neutron star 
                            and a black hole). Long GRBs, on the other hand, typically have durations >2 s and are  produced during the collapse of a 
                            massive star. </p>

                        <p> I have led multiple campaigns to search
                            for GRBs associated with FRBs detected by CHIME/FRB. Sadly, we have yet to find any 
                            FRBs which might be associated with a GRB. I have also developed 
                            an algorithm to use CHIME/FRB to constrain radio emission from transients 
                            such as GRBs.

                        <h2>Repeating Fast Radio Burst Morphology</h2>
                        
                        <p>I recently started a project using high-time resolution data collected 
                            by the CHIME/FRB telescope to study the morphology (time and frequency structure) 
                            of all-know repeating FRBs. On this note, I am also part of a smaller team within CHIME/FRB (what we
                            call a tiger team) to develop algorithms to detect microstructure in FRBs. Questions that we hope to answer with this project are: 
                            
                            <ul class="inline-bullets">
                                <li>How do the environments of repeaters different from those
                                    of non-repeaters?
                                    </li>
                                <li>Are there multiple source types for repeaters? Do they
                                    live in different environments?
                                    </li>
                                <li>Do any repeaters show changing environments?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h2>CHIME/FRB Outriggers</h2>
                        <p>The CHIME/FRB Outriggers is a transcontinental very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) network of mini-CHIME's located throughout the US and Canada.
                            As a VLBI network, the CHIME/FRB Outriggers will greatly improve the localization capabilities of CHIME such that
                            FRBs can be localized not only to host galaxies, but also to specific points (e.g., spiral arms) within those host galaxies. Currently,
                            two of the three CHIME/FRB Outriggers are operational, with the third under construction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The CHIME/FRB Outriggers are unique in that unlike traditional-VLBI telescopes, they are not steerable. Additionally,
                            the long baselines (3000 km) and frequency range (400-800 MHz) make using traditional VLBI calibrators difficult. As such,
                            we will use 100 pulsars evenly distributed within CHIME's FOV to calibrate the CHIME/FRB Outriggers. I am leading
                            a massive campaign with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to obtain positions, proper motions, and parallax for this set of pulsars. 
                            The observations for this campaign will finish in February 2024, with 
                            results expected Summer 2024. 
                        </p>

                            My MsC focused on investigating and characterizing the radio frequency interference (RFI) at CHIME.
                            I developed an algorithm to increase the efficiency of storing RFI metrics by 96% by modeling the RFI in frequency and time using polynomials.

                            on RFI, and the daily data quality.
