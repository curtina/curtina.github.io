                        <h2> Fast Radio Bursts </h2>
                        <!-- Despite having detected the first fast radio burst (FRB) over 15 years ago, 
                            there still remain many unanswered questions surrounding their origins. 
                            Their brief emission timescales suggest they originate from compact objects 
                            such as neutron stars, yet their extreme energies demand a new emission mechanism beyond 
                            what has been observed from such objects. In April 2020, an FRB-like burst was detected from a 
                            highly magnetized, young neutron star known as a magnetar. However, an FRB was later observed in
                            an environment dominated by an older stellar population, an unexpected setting for a magnetar. We also 
                            discovered that while some FRBs repeat, the majority have been seen only once 
                            from a given sky location and distance, despite many years of monitoring. Additionally, of those
                            that repeat, only one does so with a periodic activity cycle. Together, all of this raises the question
                            of whether there exist multiple populations of, and hence progenitors for, FRBs. 
                        -->

                        <p>
                            My research focuses on uncovering the origins of FRBs using the CHIME/FRB experiment.
                            In particular, I have led multiple campaigns to search for high-energy counterparts to FRBs, with a specific focus on 
                            associations with gamma-ray bursts (see my work <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FCurtin%2C%20A%2FCurtin%2C%20Alice%20P%22&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%220%2FCurtin%2C%20A%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FCurtin%2C%20A%2FCurtin%2C%20Alice%20P%22%20AND%20author_facet_hier%3A%220%2FCurtin%2C%20A%22)&q=alice%20curtin&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">here</a> ). 
                            I am also interested in what we can learn by monitoring repeating
                            FRBs and studying their morphology (time and frequency structure) at high time resolutions. My work
                            on this can be found <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241102870C/abstract">here</a>.

                        <p> I am currently one of two run coordinators for the entire CHIME/FRB experiment. This means that I spend a lot of 
                            time focused on the daily operations of CHIME/FRB. I enjoy brainstorming new ways of optimizing and improving
                            operations, with a focus on both enhancing the data quality and supporting the people behind the instrument.
                            I also enjoy thinking about radio frequency interference (RFI) e.g., characterizing it, flagging it,
                            and increasing overall awareness of it.

                        <h2>CHIME/FRB Outriggers</h2>
                        <p>The CHIME/FRB Outriggers is a transcontinental, very long baseline interferometry 
                            network that will greatly improve upon the localization capabilities 
                            of CHIME such we can not only localize FRBs to their host galaxies, but also pinpoint 
                            them within those galaxies (e.g., to a specific spiral arm).
                            Over the last four years, I have led a massive campaign with the Very Long Baseline Array
                           to obtain precise positions and proper motions for ~80 pulsars which have served as the primary
                           check sources of the Outriggers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           The VLBA observations finished in February 2025, and I plan to publish a catalog with positions, 
                           proper motion, and parallax for these ~80 pulsars within the next year. I'm particularly excited for 
                           all of the auxilary pulsar science to come out of this work.
