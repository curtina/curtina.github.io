						<h3> Space Explorers </h3>
						<p>Space Explorers is a program that brings hands-on physics activity to elementary
						schools throughout Montreal. We have five primary modules for Space Explorers on gravity, air resistance,
						momentum, density, and friction. We love bringing this to new schools throughout Montreal! Please reach out if you 
						want your school to participate, or you want to volunteer (if you are at McGill).
						</p>

						<h3> Science in Space: How to Telescope </h3>
						<p><i>Science in Space: How to Telescope</i> is a program in which middle school girls build 
							telescopes in Minecraft over the course of ~10 weeks. The program aims to foster a sense
							of belonging in physics for students of marganlized genders in this domain. Over the course of 
							the 10 weeks, students learn basic astronomy and telescope concepts, and also hone and develop
							their problem-solving and team-working skills. 
						</p>
						

						<p>
						I co-founded this program in 2021 as a collaboration between McGill Physics, Trottier 
						Space Institute, and Dell Technologies/Girls Who Game. Sitting in-between industry and academia, it is unique
						outreach program. We developed material for the 10 week program throughout Fall 2021/Winter 2022, and piloted the program
						in Spring of 2022. Since then, we have run the 10 week program another six times in the Montreal area. We were also invited
						to CIBC headquarters in Toronto to run an ~half day program on Space for girls. I am particularly fond and proud of this program, and 
						would love to chat with anyone who is interested in how it runs, or interested in running a similar program at their University.
						</p>

						<h3> Other </h3>
						<p>
                        While I have spent the majority of my outreach dedicated time (over a thousand hours at this point) on <i>Space Explorers</i> and <i>Science in Space</i> ,
						I am also involved in many other outreach initiatives at McGill. I have been a member of the McGill Physics Outreach
						Committee for five years now, four as a paid outreach coordinator and one as a supervolunteer. I have helped organize
						many of the large events for the public such as 24hr of Science where we welcomed 700 people to
						McGill Physics for hands-on activities for children, along with many smaller events. I love talking
						about outreach, and in particular inquiry-based outreach. If you are intersted in starting any initiatives,
						and want to brainstorm, please don't hesitate to be in contact.

                        <h2>Astrobites </h2>

						<p>Astrobites is an international and entirely graduate student-run astronomy 
							news platform. Most articles summarize in bite-sized pieces cutting-edge 
							astronomy papers. Summaries are aimed at undergraduate students, and Astrobites is well known
							in many astronomy undergraduate classrooms. 

							More information on Astrobites, along with its articles, can be found <a href="https://astrobites.org/category/daily-paper-summaries/">here</a>.
						</p>
						<h3> Writer </h3>
						<p> I became a writer for Astrobites in Febuary 2021, and was the first writer from a 
							Canadian institution. In order to welcome new writers to the collaboration, your "classic 
							writing rotation" only last for two years. Over this period, I wrote pieces on fast radio bursts, pulsars,
							searches for extraterrestrial intelligence, and many other topics. My articles can be found
							<a href="https://astrobites.org/author/acurtin/">here</a>.
						</p>

						<h3> Committee Memberships </h3>
						<p>While the Astrobites writing rotation is only two years, 
							I have been able to stay a part of the Astrobites community through serving on multiple committees.
							In particular, I have been a part of the Hiring Committee, Climate Committee, Social Media Comittee, and
							Admin Committee. Something I really enjoye was making reels for Astrobites, which you can find on our
							<a href="https://www.instagram.com/astrobites/">Instagram</a>.

				<!-- Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion -->
                <section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="first">

                        <h2>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Work </h2>

						<p>I am committed to creating equitable and inclusive environments 
							in physics and astronomy. This commitment drives a lot of the science communication 
							and outreach that I do. For example, there is significant research that shows that attrition in 
							physics can start as young as elementary school. <i>Science in Space</i> was founded, in part, to 
							help mitigate this attrition for students of minority genders in physics. 
						</p>

						<p> In addition to the outreach I discussed above, I also served on two committees related to 
							Equity, Diveristy, and Inclusion within the McGill Physics Department from Spring of 2020 to
							Spring 2021. The goal of the two committees were to create a statement on Equity, Diversity, and 
							Inclusion for the department, and to develop an action plan related to this statement. The 
							final values statement can be found <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/department/values-en.html">here</a>.
							I also helped in developing a resource page for McGill students, which can be
							found <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/edi/resources.html">here</a>. Most recentely, I 
							helped to develop an EDI plan for new CERC hire Jason Hessels at McGill. I am excited to be a 
							key committee member for this plan over the coming years.
