                        <h2>McGill Physics Outreach </h2>
						<h3> Space Explorers </h3>
						<p>Space Explorers is a program that brings hands-on physics activity to elementary
						schools throughout Montreal. During the pandemic, I led a major revamping of this program
						in order to create a new set of modules which could be performed at home. Along with the help
						of two other graduate students, we developed three new modules on gravity, air resistance, and
						momentum. We spent over one year developing these modules in conjunction with McGill's Faculty of Education
						and the Office of Science Outreach. The modules are designed to be inquiry-based, and to be accessible to students
						both at home and within the classroom.
					
						</p>
						<p>I ran the online version of the Space Explorers program for a bit over a year, and then the in-person
						program for two years. Over this period, the program reached over 300 kids through 10+ classrooms. I also trained over 30 
						new volunteers (undergraduates and graduate students) on inquiry-based learning in physics. While I stepped down from the primary
						coordinator role for this program in 2023, I have continued to help develop new modules (e.g., one related to the 2024 eclipse and 
						another on friction) along with providing training materials both for new volunteers and for new cooordinators. 
						</p>

						<h3> Science in Space: How to Telescope </h3>
						<p><i>Science in Space: How to Telescope</i> is a program in which middle school girls build 
							telescopes in Minecraft over the course of ~10 weeks. The program aims to foster a sense
							of belonging in physics for students of marganlized genders in this domain. Over the course of 
							the 10 weeks, students learn basic astronomy and telescope concepts, and also hone and develop
							their problem-solving and team-working skills. 
						</p>
						

						<p>
						I co-founded this program n 2021 as a collaboration between McGill Physics, Trottier 
						Space Institute, and Dell Technologies/Girls Who Game. Sitting in-between industry and academia, it is unique
						outreach program. We developed material for the 10 week program throughout Fall 2021/Winter 2022, and piloted the program
						in Spring of 2022. Since then, we have run the 10 week program another six times in the Montreal area. We were also invited
						to CIBC headquarters in Toronto to run an ~half day program on Space for girls. I am particularly fond and proud of this program, and 
						would love to chat with anyone who is interested in how it runs, or interested in running a similar program at their University.

						<h3> Other </h3>
						<p>
                        While I have spent the majority of my outreach dedicated time (over a thousand hours at this point) on <i>Space Explorers</i> and <i>Science in Space</i> ,
						I am also involved in many other outreach initiatives at McGill. I have been a member of the McGill Physics Outreach
						Committee for five years now, four as a paid outreach coordinator and one as a supervolunteer. I have helped organize
						many of the large events for the public such as 24hr of Science where we welcomed 700 people to
						McGill Physics for hands-on activities for children, along with many smaller events.

                        <h2>Astrobites </h2>

						<p>Astrobites is an international and entirely graduate student-run astronomy 
							news platform. Most articles summarize in bite-sized pieces cutting-edge 
							astronomy papers. Summaries are aimed at undergraduate students, and Astrobites is well known
							in many astronomy undergraduate classrooms. 

							More information on Astrobites, along with its articles, can be found <a href="https://astrobites.org/category/daily-paper-summaries/">here</a>.
						</p>
						<h3> Writer </h3>
						<p> I became a writer for Astrobites in Febuary 2021, and was the first writer from a 
							Canadian institution. In order to welcome new writers to the collaboration, your "classic 
							writing rotation" only last for two years. Over this period, I wrote pieces on fast radio bursts, pulsars,
							searches for extraterrestrial intelligence, and many other topics. My articles can be found
							<a href="https://astrobites.org/author/acurtin/">here</a>.
						</p>

						<h3> Committee Memberships </h3>
						<p>While I am now longer in the Astrobites writing rotation (my two years is up sadly), 
							I still get to serve on multiple committees for Astrobites. For the last three years, I have served on the Astrobites Hiring 
							Committee and the Astrobites Climate Committee. Recently, I have joined the admin 
							committee. I was also a co-chair of the social media committee for two years, and am 
							now the sole chair. Something new and exciting
							in this realm are Astrobite reels which you can find on our
							<a href="https://www.instagram.com/astrobites/">Instagram</a>.

				<!-- Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion -->

                        <h2>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Work </h2>

						<p>I am committed to creating equitable and inclusive environments 
							in physics and astronomy. This commitment drives a lot of the science communication 
							and outreach that I do. For example, there is significant research that shows that attrition in 
							physics can start as young as elementary school. <i>Science in Space</i> was founded, in part, to 
							help mitigate this attrition for students of minority genders in physics. 
						</p>

						<p> In addition to the outreach I discussed above, I also served on two committees related to 
							Equity, Diveristy, and Inclusion within the McGill Physics Department from Spring of 2020 to
							Spring 2021. The goal of the two committees were to create a statement on Equity, Diversity, and 
							Inclusion for the department, and to develop an action plan related to this statement. The 
							final values statement can be found <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/department/values-en.html">here</a>.
							I also helped in developing a resource page for McGill students, which can be
							found <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/edi/resources.html">here</a>.
