                        <h2>McGill Physics Outreach </h2>
						<h3> Space Explorers </h3>
						<p>Space Explorers is a program that brings hands-on physics activity to elementary
						schools throughout Montreal. While Space Explorers was founded in 2017, it underwent
						a major revamping durign the pandemic. I along with another McGill Graduate student
						developed new modules that could be performed at home, and were highly inquiry-learning 
						based. We created three new modules and re-structured one existing module. The four modules cover:
						density, gravity, air resistance and momentum through topics such as boats, parachutes, and craters on the moon.
						</p>
						<p>I was ran the online version of the Space Explorers program for ~1 year, and then the in-person
						program for two years. While I passed off the program in 2023, I continue to volunteer and provide guidance
						on the program.
						</p>

						<h3> Science in Space: How to Telescope </h3>
						<p>Science in Space: How to Telescope is a program in which middle school girls build 
							telescopes in Minecraft over the course of ~10 weeks. The program aims to foster a sense
							of belonging in physics for students of marganlized genders in this domain. Over the course of 
							the 10 weeks, students learn basic astronomy and telescope concepts, and also hone and develop
							their problem-solving and team-working skills. 
						</p>
						

						<p>
						This program was founded in 2021 as a collaboration between McGill Physics, Trottier 
						Space Institute, and Dell Technologies/Girls Who Game. It was founded by myself, two McGill 
						Staff members, and a contact at Dell Technologies. This program is unique in its 
						partnership between industry and academia. We piloted the program in Spring 2022 and Spring 2023. 
						We will run at five different elementary schools throughout Montreal in Fall 2023/Spring 2024.

						<h3> Other </h3>
						<p>
                        While I often refer to <i>Space Explorers</i> and <i>Science in Space</i> as my children,
						I am also involved in many other outreach initiatives at McGill. I have been a key organizer
						of many of the large events for the public e.g., 24hr where we welcomed 700 people to McGill 
						Physics for hands-on activities for children. Additionally, I have served on the McGill Physics 
						Outreach Committee for 4 years.

                        <h2>Astrobites </h2>

						<p>Astrobites is an international and entirely graduate student-run astronomy 
							news platform. Most articles summarize in bite-sized pieces cutting-edge 
							astronomy papers. Summaries are aimed at undergraduate students, and Astrobites is well known
							in many astronomy undergraduate classrooms. 

							More information on Astrobites, along with its articles, can be found <a href="https://astrobites.org/category/daily-paper-summaries/">here</a>.
						</p>
						<h3> Writer </h3>
						<p> I became a writer for Astrobites in Febuary 2021, and was the first writer from a 
							Canadian institution.  In order for new writers to join astrobites, each Astrobites
							rotation only lasts for two years. Over this period, I wrote pieces on fast radio bursts, pulsars,
							searches for extraterrestrial intelligence, and many other topics. My articles can be found
							<a href="https://astrobites.org/author/acurtin/">here</a>.
						</p>

						<h3> Committee Memberships </h3>
						<p>While I am now longer in the two year Astrobites writing rotation, I serve on multiple
							committees for Astrobites. Each year, Astrobites receives ~60-100 applications for ~20 
							spots. For the last three years, I have served on the Astrobites Hiring 
							Committee. I have also served on the Astrobites Climate Committee, which focuses on the role
							astronomers play in climate change, for the last three years. Recently, I have joined the admin 
							committee.
						</p>

						<p>In addition to serving on committees, I was a co-chair of the social media committee for two years, and am 
							now the sole chair. In this committee, we aim to share our Astrobites summaries, 
							and astronomy news in general, through different media forms. Something new and exciting
							in this realm are Astrobite reels which you can find on our
							<a href="https://www.instagram.com/astrobites/">Instagram</a>.

				<!-- Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion -->
                <section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="first">
                    <div class="content">
                        <h2>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Work </h2>

						<p>I am committed to creating equitable and inclusive environments 
							in physics and astronomy. This commitment drives a lot of the science communication 
							and outreach that I do. For example, there is significant research that shows that attrition in 
							physics can start as young as elementary school. <i>Science in Space</i> was founded, in part, to 
							help mitigate this attrition for students of minority genders in physics. 
						</p>

						<p> In addition to the outreach I discussed above, I also served on two committees related to 
							Equity, Diveristy, and Inclusion within the McGill Physics Department from Spring of 2020 to
							Spring 2021. The goal of the two committees were to create a statement on Equity, Diversity, and 
							Inclusion for the department, and to develop an action plan related to this statement. The 
							final values statement can be found <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/department/values-en.html">here</a>.
							I also helped in developing a resource page for McGill students, which can be
							found <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/edi/resources.html">here</a>.
